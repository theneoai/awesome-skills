## 📋 Legal Work Process

### Phase 1: Legal Risk Assessment

#### Risk Identification
| Risk Category | Examples | Mitigation |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| **Contractual** | Breach, ambiguity | Clear terms, review |
| **Regulatory** | Non-compliance | Monitoring, training |
| **Litigation** | Lawsuits, disputes | Early resolution |
| **IP** | Infringement | Protection strategy |
| **Employment** | Discrimination, wrongful termination | Policies, training |

#### Risk Matrix
```
Likelihood × Impact = Risk Level
- High Likelihood + High Impact = Critical
- High Likelihood + Low Impact = Moderate
- Low Likelihood + High Impact = Serious
- Low Likelihood + Low Impact = Minor
```

### Phase 2: Contract Drafting & Review

#### Contract Structure
1. **Preamble**: Parties, date, recitals
2. **Definitions**: Key terms
3. **Obligations**: Each party's commitments
4. **Payment**: Pricing, terms, invoicing
5. **Term & Termination**: Duration, exit rights
6. **IP**: Ownership, licenses
7. **Confidentiality**: NDA provisions
8. **Limitation of Liability**: Cap, exclusions
9. **Indemnification**: Protection clauses
10. **Dispute Resolution**: Governing law, venue
11. **General Provisions**: Assignment, notices, amendments

#### Key Clauses Checklist
- [ ] **Scope**: Clearly defined deliverables
- [ ] **Payment**: Net 30, milestone-based?
- [ ] **IP**: Who owns what?
- [ ] **Warranties**: Express and implied
- [ ] **Liability**: Mutual? Capped?
- [ ] **Termination**: For cause? Convenience?
- [ ] **Governing Law**: Which jurisdiction?

#### Red Flags
- **Unilateral Terms**: One-sided obligations
- **Unlimited Liability**: No cap on damages
- **Auto-Renewal**: Without notice
- **Broad Indemnification**: Excessive risk
- **Vague Language**: Ambiguous terms
- **Missing Termination**: No exit rights

### Phase 3: Compliance & Regulatory

#### Privacy Compliance (GDPR/CCPA)

- **Wage & Hour**: Overtime, minimum wage
- **Anti-Discrimination**: EEO compliance
- **Leave**: FMLA, sick leave
- **Safety**: OSHA requirements
- **Termination**: At-will, wrongful termination

### Phase 4: Dispute Resolution

#### Litigation Avoidance

- **Negotiation**: Direct party discussions

#### Litigation Management
- **Budget**: Legal cost estimates

- **Documentation**: Preserve relevant records

## ✅ Best Practices

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Last-Minute Review**: Legal as bottleneck

3. **Scope Creep**: Unclear deliverables
4. **Missing Indemnities**: Inadequate protection
5. **Wrong Governing Law**: Unfavorable jurisdiction
6. **IP Ambiguity**: Ownership disputes
7. **No Termination Rights**: Locked in forever
