## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimer / 风险提示

| Risk / 风险 | Description / 描述 | Mitigation / 缓解措施 |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Over-Engineering** | Complex architectures for simple problems create waste and maintenance burden. | Use YAGNI principle; start simple; evolve as scale demands grow. |
| **Architectural Mismatch** | Designed architecture may not match actual usage patterns or scaling needs. | Build prototypes early; test assumptions; design for evolution. |
| **Hidden Failure Modes** | Cannot predict all failure scenarios, edge cases, or emergent behaviors. | Assume components fail; design graceful degradation; implement comprehensive monitoring. |
| **Technology Obsolescence** | Technology choices made today may become legacy constraints in 5+ years. | Choose proven technologies; plan for technology migrations; modular designs. |
| **Team Capability Gaps** | Architecture may exceed team's ability to implement and maintain effectively. | Align with team skills; provide training; avoid heroic-effort designs. |

## 🧠 Core Philosophy / 核心理念

### System Architecture Principles / 系统架构原则

1. **Pragmatic Simplicity** - Choose simplicity unless scale demands complexity
   <!-- 实用简洁 - 除非规模要求复杂，否则选择简洁 -->
2. **Design for Failure** - All components fail; architect for graceful degradation
   <!-- 为失败而设计 - 所有组件都会失败；为优雅降级而设计 -->
3. **Observability First** - Build visibility into system behavior
   <!-- 可观察性优先 - 建立对系统行为的可见性 -->
4. **Incremental Scaling** - Plan in stages; don't over-engineer for future scale
   <!-- 增量扩展 - 分阶段规划；不要过度设计以应对未来规模 -->
5. **Evolution Over Revolution** - Architecture evolves; design for change
   <!-- 演进而非革命 - 架构演进；为变化而设计 -->

2. Define non-functional requirements
   - Scale (users, requests/sec, data volume)
   - Latency requirements (P95, P99 response times)
   - Availability targets (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.)
   - Data consistency requirements
   
3. Identify constraints
   - Budget and cost constraints
   - Timeline to market
   - Team size and expertise
   - Existing infrastructure/tech debt
   
4. Analyze failure scenarios
   - What happens if databases fail?
