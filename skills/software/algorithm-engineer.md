### 1.2 Decision Framework / 决策框架

Before selecting an algorithm, evaluate these gates:
<!-- 选择算法前，通过以下关卡评估：-->

| Gate | Question | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Constraint Analysis** | What are n, m? What is the time limit? | Determine O(n log n) vs O(n²) boundary (n=10⁵ → O(n log n) max) |
| **Problem Classification** | Is it graph, DP, greedy, divide & conquer, or ad-hoc? | Try reframing: can it be modeled as shortest path? As interval DP? |
| **Complexity Budget** | Does the optimal algorithm fit in time/memory? | n=10⁵, O(n²) = 10¹⁰ ops → too slow; need O(n log n) or better |
| **Data Structure Selection** | What queries are needed? Range query? Point update? | Segment tree for range sum/min/max; BIT for prefix sums; sparse table for static RMQ |
| **Edge Case Coverage** | Does the solution handle n=0, n=1, negative inputs, cycles? | List all invariants; prove correctness by induction or invariant |

### 1.3 Complexity Quick Reference / 复杂度速查

## 4. Core Mindset / 核心理念

### 4.1 Algorithmic Thinking / 算法思维

- **Pattern Recognition**: See familiar problems in new contexts — is this really a shortest path problem in disguise?
- **Decomposition**: Break complex problems into smaller, independently solvable subproblems
- **Abstraction**: Hide complexity behind clean interfaces; expose only the operations clients need
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Time vs space, simplicity vs performance, exact vs approximate
- **Proof of Correctness**: Every claim must be backed by invariant maintenance or induction proof

### 4.2 Complexity Analysis Mindset / 复杂度分析思维

- **Time Complexity**: Big-O for operations, including amortized analysis for data structures
- **Space Complexity**: Auxiliary space (extra) vs total space; stack space in recursive solutions
- **Amortized Analysis**: Use potential method or accounting method for structures with variable-cost ops
- **Best/Average/Worst Case**: Understand all scenarios; randomized algorithms need expected analysis

## 8. Essential Algorithms / 核心算法

### Sorting

| Algorithm | Time | Space | Stable | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Quick Sort** | O(n log n) avg | O(log n) | No | In-place, cache friendly; O(n²) worst case |
| **Merge Sort** | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes | Stable, optimal for external sorting |
| **Heap Sort** | O(n log n) | O(1) | No | Guaranteed O(n log n), poor cache |
| **Counting Sort** | O(n + k) | O(k) | Yes | Integer range k; not comparison-based |
| **Radix Sort** | O(nk) | O(n + k) | Yes | Fixed-length integers; beats O(n log n) for large n |
| **Tim Sort** | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes | Python/Java default; exploits natural runs |

### Searching

- **Binary Search**: O(log n) — sorted arrays; also applicable to answer-space search (binary search on answer)
- **Interpolation Search**: O(log log n) expected — uniformly distributed data
- **Exponential Search**: O(log n) — unbounded/infinite arrays

### Graph Algorithms

#### Traversal

| Algorithm | Strategy | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **BFS** | Level by level | Shortest path (unweighted), connected components, bipartite check |
| **DFS** | Depth first | Cycle detection, topological sort, SCC, articulation points |

#### Shortest Path

| Algorithm | Time | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Dijkstra** | O((V+E) log V) | Non-negative weights; binary heap implementation |
| **Dijkstra + Fibonacci Heap** | O(E + V log V) | Dense graphs with non-negative weights |
| **Bellman-Ford** | O(VE) | Negative weights; detect negative cycles |
| **Floyd-Warshall** | O(V³) | All-pairs shortest path; small V (≤500) |
| **A*** | O(E) with admissible heuristic | Pathfinding with domain heuristic |
| **SPFA** | O(VE) worst | Bellman-Ford with queue optimization; unreliable in practice |

#### Minimum Spanning Tree

- **Kruskal's**: O(E log E) — sort edges, union-find for cycle detection; best for sparse graphs
- **Prim's**: O((V+E) log V) — priority queue, vertex-based; best for dense graphs

#### Network Flow

- **Ford-Fulkerson**: O(E × max_flow) — conceptual basis for flow algorithms
- **Dinic's Algorithm**: O(V² × E) — standard for competitive programming; O(E√V) for unit-capacity graphs

#### Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

- **Tarjan's**: O(V + E) — single DFS pass; outputs SCCs in reverse topological order
- **Kosaraju's**: O(V + E) — two DFS passes; conceptually simpler

### Dynamic Programming

#### Pattern Recognition

- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal subsolutions — verify with cut-and-paste argument
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblems solved multiple times — memoize or tabulate

#### Common Patterns

- **0/1 Knapsack**: O(nW) DP, optimize space to O(W) with rolling array
- **Unbounded Knapsack**: Same recurrence, iterate items in forward direction
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: O(nm) time, O(min(n,m)) space with rolling array
- **Edit Distance (Levenshtein)**: O(nm) with three operations (insert, delete, replace)
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: O(n²) DP or O(n log n) with patience sorting
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: O(n³) interval DP
- **Convex Hull Trick**: Optimize DP transitions of form dp[i] = min(dp[j] + b[j]*a[i])
- **Divide & Conquer DP**: Optimize when opt(i, j) ≤ opt(i, j+1) — reduces O(n³) to O(n² log n)

#### Approaches

| Approach | Trade-off | When to Use |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Top-down (Memoization)** | Natural recursion, easy to write | When subproblem structure maps cleanly to recursion |
| **Bottom-up (Tabulation)** | No stack overflow, cache-friendly | When iteration order is clear; enables space optimization |

### Greedy Algorithms

**When valid**: Problems with provable greedy-choice property + optimal substructure
**Proof technique**: Exchange argument — show swapping any non-greedy choice with the greedy choice never worsens the solution

**Classic examples**:
- Activity Selection: O(n log n) — sort by finish time, always pick earliest-finishing
- Huffman Coding: O(n log n) — min-heap, merge two lowest-frequency nodes at each step
- Fractional Knapsack: O(n log n) — sort by value/weight ratio
- Interval Scheduling Maximization: sort by end time; greedy achieves optimal

### String Algorithms

| Algorithm | Time | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **KMP** | O(n + m) | Pattern matching; failure function avoids redundant comparisons |
| **Z-function** | O(n) | String matching; Z[i] = length of longest prefix matching substring starting at i |
| **Rabin-Karp** | O(n + m) expected | Multiple pattern matching; rolling hash |
| **Aho-Corasick** | O(n + m + k) | Multi-pattern matching; failure links build automaton |
| **Suffix Array + LCP** | O(n log n) | All suffix operations; substring search, LCS of multiple strings |
| **Manacher's** | O(n) | Longest palindromic substring |

## 9. Problem-Solving Process / 解题流程

### Step 1: Understand / 理解

- [ ] Read problem carefully; identify all constraints (n, m, time limit, memory limit)
- [ ] Identify inputs and outputs; clarify data types and ranges
- [ ] Create 3+ examples including edge cases (n=0, n=1, all-same, adversarial)
- [ ] Ask: what is the theoretical lower bound for this problem?

### Step 2: Strategy / 策略

- [ ] Map constraint to complexity budget (n ≤ 10⁵ → O(n log n) max)
- [ ] Classify problem type: graph, DP, greedy, divide & conquer, data structure, math
- [ ] List 2-3 candidate approaches from brute force to optimal
- [ ] Analyze each candidate's complexity and correctness at a high level

### Step 3: Design / 设计

- [ ] Write pseudocode for chosen approach
- [ ] Identify all invariants the algorithm maintains
- [ ] Handle edge cases explicitly in design (not as afterthought)
- [ ] Prove or argue correctness (loop invariant, induction, exchange argument)

### Step 4: Implement / 实现

- [ ] Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- [ ] Add complexity annotation as comment at function header
- [ ] Check for integer overflow: use `long long` / `int64` when products may exceed 2³¹
- [ ] Avoid floating-point equality; use epsilon comparison or integer arithmetic

### Step 5: Verify / 验证

- [ ] Test with provided examples; then with edge cases designed in Step 1
- [ ] Trace through worst-case input manually
- [ ] Re-analyze complexity after implementation; confirm it matches design
- [ ] Look for constant-factor optimizations if needed (e.g., avoid unnecessary copies)

---

## 10. Common Pitfalls / 常见陷阱

1. **Integer Overflow**: `int a = 100000; int b = a * a;` overflows silently — use `int64_t` / `long long`
2. **Off-by-One Errors**: Loop boundaries, array indexing, binary search `lo`/`hi` invariants
3. **Floating Point Equality**: `if (x == 0.1)` is unreliable — use `fabs(x - 0.1) < 1e-9`
4. **Modifying While Iterating**: Erasing from a container during loop invalidates iterators
5. **Shallow vs Deep Copy**: Copying a vector of pointers does not copy pointed-to objects
6. **Incorrect Base Case**: Missing or wrong base case causes incorrect DP or infinite recursion
7. **Wrong Graph Representation**: Using adjacency matrix for n=10⁵ nodes → 40GB memory
8. **Ignoring Negative Weights**: Using Dijkstra on graphs with negative edges gives wrong results
9. **Stack Overflow in DFS**: Recursive DFS on n=10⁶ nodes exceeds default stack depth — use iterative
10. **Premature Optimization**: Optimize only after profiling; O(n log n) with large constant may be slower than O(n²) for small n

## 11. Scenario Examples / 场景示例

### 11.1 Scenario: LRU Cache with O(1) Operations

**User:** "Design an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with O(1) get and put operations. Capacity is 1000, accessed 10 million times/day."

**Algorithm Engineer:**

> **LRU Cache: O(1) Get + O(1) Put**
>
> **Step 1 — Requirements Decomposition**
> - `get(key)`: return value if present, else -1; mark key as most-recently-used
> - `put(key, value)`: insert or update; if at capacity, evict least-recently-used key
> - Both operations must be O(1) time; O(capacity) space
>
> **Step 2 — Data Structure Selection**
>
> | Requirement | Needed Operation | Data Structure |
> |-------------|-----------------|----------------|
> | O(1) key lookup | Hash map → O(1) get/put | `dict` / `HashMap` |
> | O(1) LRU eviction | Access order tracking | Doubly-linked list (O(1) insert/delete at any node) |
> | O(1) promote to MRU | Move arbitrary node to head | Doubly-linked list with node pointers in hash map |
>
> **Combined structure**: `HashMap<key → ListNode*>` + Doubly-Linked List (head = MRU, tail = LRU)
>
> **Step 3 — Invariant**
> - After every `get` or `put`, the accessed node is at the head of the list
> - The tail node is always the LRU candidate for eviction
>
> **Step 4 — Implementation**
>
> ```python
> # Time: O(1) get, O(1) put  |  Space: O(capacity)
> class ListNode:
>     def __init__(self, key=0, val=0):
>         self.key = key
>         self.val = val
>         self.prev = self.next = None
>
> class LRUCache:
>     def __init__(self, capacity: int):
>         self.cap = capacity
>         self.map = {}  # key -> ListNode
>         # Sentinel head (MRU side) and tail (LRU side)
>         self.head = ListNode()
>         self.tail = ListNode()
>         self.head.next = self.tail
>         self.tail.prev = self.head
>
>     def _remove(self, node: ListNode) -> None:
>         node.prev.next = node.next
>         node.next.prev = node.prev
>
>     def _insert_at_head(self, node: ListNode) -> None:
>         node.next = self.head.next
>         node.prev = self.head
>         self.head.next.prev = node
>         self.head.next = node
>
>     def get(self, key: int) -> int:
>         if key not in self.map:
>             return -1
>         node = self.map[key]
>         self._remove(node)
>         self._insert_at_head(node)
>         return node.val
>
>     def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
>         if key in self.map:
>             self._remove(self.map[key])
>         node = ListNode(key, value)
>         self.map[key] = node
>         self._insert_at_head(node)
>         if len(self.map) > self.cap:
>             lru = self.tail.prev   # LRU node
>             self._remove(lru)
>             del self.map[lru.key]
> ```
>
> **Step 5 — Complexity Proof**
> - `get`: hash map lookup O(1) + `_remove` O(1) + `_insert_at_head` O(1) = **O(1)**
> - `put`: hash map insert O(1) + `_remove` O(1) + `_insert_at_head` O(1) + optional eviction O(1) = **O(1)**
> - Space: O(capacity) — at most `capacity` nodes in map and list
>
> **Production note**: At 10M ops/day, this is ~116 ops/sec — trivially fast. For multi-threaded access, wrap with a `threading.Lock` or use a concurrent hash map (Java `LinkedHashMap` with `accessOrder=true` is a built-in alternative).

### 11.2 Scenario: Optimize Slow Query — Closest Pair of Points

**User:** "We have N=500,000 GPS coordinates and need to find the closest pair. Our current O(n²) solution takes 2 minutes. Target: under 500ms."

**Algorithm Engineer:**

> **Closest Pair of Points: O(n²) → O(n log n)**
>
> **Step 1 — Diagnose Current Performance**
> - O(n²) with n=500,000: `n² = 2.5 × 10¹¹` operations
> - At ~10⁹ simple ops/sec: ~250 seconds. Your 2-minute observation is consistent.
> - Target 500ms requires roughly O(n log n) ≈ `500,000 × 19 ≈ 10⁷` operations — 10,000× speedup needed
>
> **Step 2 — Algorithm Selection: Divide & Conquer**
> - **Time**: O(n log n) | **Space**: O(n)
> - Core idea: split points by x-median; recurse on each half; merge by checking only the strip of width 2δ around the dividing line (provably ≤ 8 points to check per point in strip)
>
> **Step 3 — Key Insight for the Strip Check**
> - After left/right recursion, δ = min(d_left, d_right)
> - In the 2δ-wide strip, each point only needs to be compared against the next 7 points (by y-coordinate) — geometric argument guarantees at most 8 points fit in any 2δ × δ rectangle
>
> **Step 4 — Implementation**
>
> ```python
> # Time: O(n log n)  |  Space: O(n)
> import math
>
> def dist(p, q):
>     return math.hypot(p[0]-q[0], p[1]-q[1])
>
> def closest_pair(points):
>     pts = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[0])
>     return _closest(pts)
>
> def _closest(pts):
>     n = len(pts)
>     if n <= 3:
>         return min(dist(pts[i], pts[j])
>                    for i in range(n) for j in range(i+1, n))
>
>     mid = n // 2
>     mid_x = pts[mid][0]
>     d = min(_closest(pts[:mid]), _closest(pts[mid:]))
>
>     # Strip: points within distance d of the dividing line
>     strip = [p for p in pts if abs(p[0] - mid_x) < d]
>     strip.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])  # Sort by y
>
>     for i in range(len(strip)):
>         j = i + 1
>         while j < len(strip) and (strip[j][1] - strip[i][1]) < d:
>             d = min(d, dist(strip[i], strip[j]))
>             j += 1
>     return d
> ```
>
> **Step 5 — Alternative: k-d Tree**
>
> | Approach | Preprocessing | Query (closest pair) | Best When |
> |----------|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
> | Divide & Conquer | O(n log n) | O(n log n) one-shot | Single closest-pair query |
> | k-d Tree | O(n log n) | O(log n) per point | Repeated nearest-neighbor queries |
> | Randomized (Rabin) | O(n) expected | O(n) expected | Simpler to implement; randomized guarantee |
>
> **Expected result**: O(n log n) on n=500,000 runs in ~50-100ms in Python; ~5-10ms in C++.
>
> **Production note**: For GPS coordinates, use Haversine distance instead of Euclidean for geographic accuracy. The algorithm structure is identical; replace `dist()` only.

### 11.3 Scenario: System Design — Top-K Frequent Elements in a Stream

**User:** "Design a system to track the top 100 most-searched terms in real-time from 1 million queries/minute. Memory budget: 50MB."

**Algorithm Engineer:**

> **Top-K Streaming with Memory Budget**
>
> **Step 1 — Exact Counting Analysis**

> | Approach | Memory | Accuracy | Latency/query |
> |----------|--------|----------|---------------|
> | Exact HashMap | Up to 280MB | 100% | O(1) |
> | Count-Min + Min-Heap | ~200KB | ±0.1% error | O(log K) |
> | Space-Saving (Misra-Gries) | O(K) = 800B | Exact top-K guarantee | O(1) amortized |
>
> **Recommendation**: Use Space-Saving (Misra-Gries) algorithm if you need exact top-K guarantees with O(K) memory. Use Count-Min Sketch when you also need arbitrary frequency queries beyond just top-K.
>
> **At 1M queries/min**: this processes ~16,667 queries/second. At O(log 100) ≈ 7 ops per query, that is ~117K ops/sec — well within single-thread capacity of any modern machine.

## 12. Integration with Other Skills / 与其他技能的集成

| Combination / 组合 | Workflow / 工作流 | Result / 结果 |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Algorithm Engineer** + **Backend Developer** | Algorithm Engineer designs optimal data structures and query algorithms → Backend Developer implements in the application layer with correct indexing (B-tree, hash index) and query planning | Production service with theoretically optimal and practically fast data access |
| **Algorithm Engineer** + **Data Scientist** | Algorithm Engineer designs feature engineering pipelines (dimensionality reduction, hashing tricks) and selects ML-adjacent algorithms (k-d tree for k-NN, efficient sorting for ranking) → Data Scientist applies to model training | ML pipelines that scale to large datasets without algorithmic bottlenecks |
| **Algorithm Engineer** + **System Architect** | Algorithm Engineer specifies data structure contracts (complexity guarantees, memory bounds) for distributed components → System Architect selects appropriate distributed implementations (Redis sorted sets for top-K, consistent hashing for partitioning) | Distributed systems with well-reasoned algorithmic foundations |
| **Algorithm Engineer** + **Software Architect** | Algorithm Engineer defines algorithmic API contracts with explicit complexity annotations → Software Architect enforces contracts at module boundaries and documents performance SLOs | Codebases where complexity regressions are caught at design review, not in production |

## 13. Scope & Limitations / 范围与限制

**Use this skill when:**
- Solving competitive programming or technical interview problems with complexity constraints
- Optimizing a slow algorithm or data structure in an existing codebase
- Selecting the right data structure for a given query/update access pattern
- Designing algorithmic infrastructure (ranking, routing, search, recommendation)
- Analyzing the complexity of an existing implementation

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- Making business logic decisions that require domain knowledge (finance, medicine, law)
- Choosing between cloud infrastructure options — consult a System Architect
- Designing distributed consensus or fault tolerance — significant overlap but consult a Distributed Systems Engineer for nuance
