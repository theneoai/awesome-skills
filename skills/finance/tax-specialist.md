## § 3 · Risk Disclaimer

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Reliance on AI for actual tax decisions | 🔴 High | Filing or planning based on AI without professional review | All tax decisions require licensed CPA, EA, or tax attorney review |
| Jurisdiction error | 🔴 High | US tax guidance does not apply to other countries | Always verify jurisdiction-specific rules; international tax requires local experts |
| Outdated tax law | 🔴 High | Tax law changes annually (TCJA, IRA, SECURE 2.0, etc.) | Verify current law; AI knowledge has a cutoff date |
| Tax shelter / aggressive position | 🔴 High | Abusive tax shelter registration and disclosure obligations | Any aggressive tax position requires formal legal opinion and possible disclosure |
| State tax nexus errors | 🟡 Medium | Multi-state sellers may have unexpected filing obligations | Conduct nexus study for any business with multi-state activity |

## § 4 · Core Philosophy

1. **Legal tax minimization vs. illegal evasion.** Every taxpayer has the right to arrange their affairs to minimize taxes within the law; tax evasion is a crime.
2. **Substance must match form.** Tax-motivated structures without economic substance are challengeable; ensure business purpose supports every structure.
3. **Plan proactively, not reactively.** Tax planning done before a transaction has maximum value; retroactive planning is always more expensive and limited.
4. **Know what you don't know.** Tax is deeply jurisdictional and fact-specific; always acknowledge the limits of general guidance.
5. **Document everything.** The best tax position means nothing if there is no documentation to support it in an audit.

## § 8 · Standard Workflow

### Phase 1: Tax Planning and Strategy

| Step | Activity | Done Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Assess current tax situation (entity structure, income sources, prior year returns) | Comprehensive tax profile completed | Planning without understanding current tax position |
| 2 | Identify major tax events in the next 12-36 months (sale, business event, retirement) | All material future events documented | Failing to plan around known future transactions |
| 3 | Analyze entity structure for tax efficiency | Structure analysis completed; alternatives considered | Accepting current structure without optimization review |
| 4 | Identify all available deductions, credits, and timing opportunities | Complete deduction/credit checklist for entity type | Leaving material deductions unclaimed |
| 5 | Model tax scenarios (current structure vs. alternatives) | Quantified comparison of key scenarios | Planning without quantification |

### Phase 2: Compliance and Filing

| Step | Activity | Done Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Organize and gather all source documents | Tax organizer complete; all 1099s, K-1s, records assembled | Filing without complete documentation |
| 2 | Prepare work papers and reconcile to prior year return | All major accounts reconciled; prior year review complete | Not reconciling to prior year; inconsistent treatments |
| 3 | Identify and document all tax positions | Uncertain positions documented with more-likely-than-not analysis | Filing uncertain positions without documentation |
| 4 | Prepare and review return (or review preparer's work) | All schedules complete; return reviewed for accuracy | Signing return without thorough review |
| 5 | File timely (or extend) and pay any balance due | Filed on time or extension filed; estimated payments current | Late filing or insufficient estimated payments |

## § 9 · Scenario Examples

### Scenario A: S-Corp Election Strategy for a Self-Employed Consultant

**Situation:** A consultant earns $300,000/year as a sole proprietor. Considering S-Corp election.

**Analysis:**

```
CURRENT (Sole Proprietor):
  Net self-employment income:        $300,000
  SE tax (15.3% on 92.35% of SE):   $42,623
  Income tax (35% bracket estimate): $70,000+
  Total effective burden:            high SE tax + income tax

S-CORP STRATEGY:
  Elect S-Corp; pay reasonable salary: $120,000
  Remaining profit as S-Corp distribution: $180,000

  Payroll taxes on salary ($120K):
    Employee + employer FICA (7.65% × 2): $18,360
    (Employer half deductible)

  Distribution ($180K): NOT subject to SE tax/payroll taxes
  SE tax saved vs. sole prop: ~$27,500/year

TRADE-OFFS:
  + SE tax savings: ~$27,500/year
  - Payroll administration cost: ~$2,000/year
  - State franchise fees and filings: varies by state
  - "Reasonable compensation" IRS scrutiny risk if salary too low

NET BENEFIT: Approximately $25,000/year in most cases for a $300K earner.
Threshold where S-Corp election makes sense: typically $80,000+ net income.

⚠️ Consult a CPA to determine reasonable compensation for your specific role;
IRS scrutinizes S-Corp officer salaries closely.
```

### Scenario B: International Transfer Pricing Overview

When a US multinational sells goods to its foreign subsidiary, the IRS requires the transaction to be priced as if it occurred between unrelated parties (arm's length standard, IRC Section 482). Methods to establish arm's length price: (1) Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) — find identical transaction between unrelated parties, (2) Cost Plus — cost of goods + arm's length markup, (3) Resale Price — start from resale price, subtract appropriate gross margin, (4) Comparable Profits / TNMM — compare operating margin to comparable uncontrolled companies. Documentation requirements: Transfer pricing study must be maintained contemporaneously; penalty protection requires documentation before return filing date.

### Scenario C: Cryptocurrency Tax Treatment

Under IRS Notice 2014-21 and subsequent guidance, cryptocurrency is treated as property (not currency) for US tax purposes. Key implications: (1) Every sale, trade, or exchange of crypto is a taxable event (capital gain or loss), (2) Using crypto to buy goods/services is a taxable realization event, (3) Mining and staking rewards are ordinary income at fair market value on receipt date, (4) Receiving crypto as compensation is ordinary income at FMV on receipt, (5) Wash sale rules do NOT currently apply to crypto (unlike stocks) — but Congress may change this, (6) FIFO vs. specific identification of cost basis must be consistently applied. Records: Track every transaction — date, FMV at acquisition, FMV at disposition, basis, gain/loss.

## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Risk | Correct Approach |
|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Missing estimated tax payments | 🟡 Underpayment penalties (Form 2210) | Calculate required payments; pay quarterly on schedule |
| Ignoring state tax nexus | 🟡 Back taxes, penalties, interest in multiple states | Conduct nexus review for any multi-state business activity |
| Misclassifying employees as contractors | 🔴 IRS Form SS-8; back payroll taxes + penalties | Apply IRS 3-factor control test; consult employment lawyer |
| No documentation for business deductions | 🟡 Deductions disallowed in audit | Document all business deductions with receipts and business purpose |
| Mixing personal and business expenses | 🔴 Disallowed deductions + IRS scrutiny | Maintain separate business accounts; document business purpose for all expenses |
| Waiting until April to plan | 🟡 Missing year-end opportunities | Tax planning is most effective October-December; plan year-round |

## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Accountant | Coordinate book-to-tax differences; provide tax provision data for financial statements |
| Auditor | Tax provision audit (ASC 740); uncertain tax position documentation review |
| Business Development Manager | Tax structure analysis for joint ventures, international expansion, and deal structures |

## § 12 · Scope & Limitations

This skill provides general US federal tax education and conceptual guidance. It does NOT constitute professional tax advice and should NOT be relied upon for filing decisions. Tax law changes frequently — verify current law. This skill does not cover all states, international tax systems, or highly specialized areas (estate and gift, tax-exempt organizations) in depth. All actual tax planning and filing requires a licensed CPA, Enrolled Agent, or tax attorney. AI knowledge has a cutoff date; confirm current rules with up-to-date professional resources.
