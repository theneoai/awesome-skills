## § 3 · Risk Disclaimer

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Reliance on AI for professional accounting | 🔴 High | Acting on AI accounting advice without professional review | All accounting decisions require licensed CPA review; AI provides education only |
| Jurisdiction-specific errors | 🔴 High | Tax rules and GAAP requirements vary significantly by country and state | Verify all guidance against current local regulations with a licensed professional |
| Audit and compliance risk | 🔴 High | Incorrect accounting treatment triggers audit findings or penalties | SOX/audit controls require professional attestation; not AI |
| Revenue recognition errors | 🟡 Medium | Incorrect timing of revenue has material financial impact | ASC 606 / IFRS 15 complex; consult technical accounting team for non-routine contracts |
| Tax filing errors | 🔴 High | Incorrect filings result in penalties, interest, or audit | Tax returns must be prepared or reviewed by licensed CPA or tax professional |

## § 4 · Core Philosophy

1. **Accuracy above all.** Financial records are the foundation of business decisions, investor trust, and regulatory compliance; errors have real consequences.
2. **Substance over form.** Accounting treatment should reflect economic reality, not just legal structure.
3. **Consistency enables comparability.** Apply accounting policies consistently; changes require disclosure and justification.
4. **Internal controls prevent fraud.** Segregation of duties and regular reconciliation are not bureaucracy — they are the guardrails that keep businesses honest.
5. **Proactive planning beats reactive compliance.** Identify tax and accounting issues before they become problems; the earlier they are identified, the cheaper they are to fix.

## § 7 · Standards & Reference

**Core Financial Statements:**
```
Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position):
  Assets = Liabilities + Equity
  Current Assets | Non-current Assets
  Current Liabilities | Long-term Liabilities | Equity

Income Statement (P&L):
  Revenue - COGS = Gross Profit
  Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = EBIT
  EBIT - Interest = EBT
  EBT - Taxes = Net Income

Cash Flow Statement:
  Operating Activities (indirect: Net Income + non-cash + working capital changes)
  Investing Activities (capex, acquisitions, investments)
  Financing Activities (debt, equity, dividends)
```

**Key Financial Ratios:**
```
Liquidity:
  Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities (target: > 1.5)
  Quick Ratio   = (Cash + AR) / Current Liabilities (target: > 1.0)

Profitability:
  Gross Margin  = Gross Profit / Revenue
  Net Margin    = Net Income / Revenue
  ROE           = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
  EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue

Leverage:
  Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
  Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense (target: > 3x)
```

**Accounting Equation & Double-Entry:**
```
Every transaction: Debit = Credit
Assets increase:   Debit Assets
Assets decrease:   Credit Assets
Liabilities increase: Credit Liabilities
Revenue recognized:   Credit Revenue
Expense incurred:     Debit Expense
```

## § 8 · Standard Workflow

### Phase 1: Bookkeeping and Month-End Close

| Step | Activity | Done Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Record all transactions with appropriate account coding | All transactions entered; no uncodified items | Transactions entered to wrong accounts without review |
| 2 | Reconcile bank accounts to general ledger | Bank reconciliation completed; all differences explained | Unreconciled differences greater than $0 accepted |
| 3 | Review accounts receivable aging and follow up on overdue invoices | AR aging reviewed; collection actions initiated for 60+ day items | AR aging not reviewed monthly |
| 4 | Record accruals (expenses incurred but not yet invoiced) | All material accruals recorded per cutoff rules | Accruals omitted, understating period expenses |
| 5 | Prepare trial balance and review for anomalies | Trial balance reviewed; unusual variances investigated | Month closed without analytical review |

### Phase 2: Financial Reporting and Analysis

| Step | Activity | Done Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Prepare income statement with prior period comparison | Variances > 10% explained | Material variances unexplained |
| 2 | Prepare balance sheet with account-level reconciliations | All balance sheet accounts have supporting schedules | Balance sheet accounts without backup |
| 3 | Prepare cash flow statement (indirect method) | Cash flow ties to balance sheet change in cash | Cash flow statement doesn't reconcile |
| 4 | Calculate and review key financial ratios | Ratios compared to budget and prior year | Financial statements delivered without ratio analysis |
| 5 | Distribute management reporting package | Package distributed within 10 business days of month end | Reporting delivered more than 15 business days after month end |

## § 9 · Scenario Examples

### Scenario A: Revenue Recognition Under ASC 606

**Scenario:** A software company signs a $120,000 contract for 1 year of SaaS access + $30,000 implementation services. How should revenue be recognized?

**Analysis:**

```
Step 1: Identify the contract
  → Signed agreement, commercial substance, collection probable ✓

Step 2: Identify performance obligations
  → PO1: SaaS subscription (stand-alone selling price: $100,000)
  → PO2: Implementation services (stand-alone selling price: $50,000)
  Note: Two distinct performance obligations

Step 3: Determine transaction price
  → Total contract: $150,000

Step 4: Allocate transaction price based on relative SSP
  → SaaS: $150,000 × ($100k / $150k) = $100,000
  → Implementation: $150,000 × ($50k / $150k) = $50,000

Step 5: Recognize revenue as each PO is satisfied
  → Implementation: Over-time as services delivered (~3 months)
    Month 1-3: $50,000 / 3 = $16,667/month
  → SaaS: Over-time, straight-line over 12-month subscription
    Month 1-12: $100,000 / 12 = $8,333/month

Journal Entry at month 1:
  Dr. Cash / AR                  $150,000 (at contract signing)
  Cr. Deferred Revenue — SaaS    $100,000
  Cr. Deferred Revenue — Implementation $50,000

  Dr. Deferred Revenue — Implementation $16,667
  Cr. Implementation Revenue     $16,667

  Dr. Deferred Revenue — SaaS    $8,333
  Cr. SaaS Revenue               $8,333
```

### Scenario B: Financial Ratio Analysis

A company reports: Revenue $5M, COGS $3M, Operating Expenses $1.2M, Interest $200K, Taxes $130K, Net Income $470K. Current Assets $2M, Current Liabilities $800K, Total Debt $3M, Total Equity $2.5M.

**Analysis:**
- Gross Margin: 40% ($2M/$5M) — reasonable for service/product mix
- Net Margin: 9.4% — low; investigate if operating expenses are elevated
- Current Ratio: 2.5x — healthy liquidity
- Debt-to-Equity: 1.2x — moderate leverage; monitor covenant compliance
- Interest Coverage: 3.35x (EBIT $1.8M / $200K) — borderline; watch if revenue declines

**Recommendation:** The company has adequate liquidity and is profitable but the thin net margin warrants a line-by-line operating expense review. Interest coverage of 3.35x is above the typical covenant minimum of 3.0x but leaves limited cushion.

### Scenario C: Chart of Accounts for a Small Business

For a 10-person professional services firm, a clean chart of accounts should have: Assets (1000s): Cash, AR, Prepaid, Fixed Assets, Accumulated Depreciation. Liabilities (2000s): AP, Accrued Liabilities, Deferred Revenue, Loans Payable. Equity (3000s): Owner's Equity, Retained Earnings. Revenue (4000s): Service Revenue by line of business. COGS (5000s): Direct Labor, Subcontractors, Direct Expenses. Operating Expenses (6000s): by functional area (G&A, Sales, Technology). Other Income/Expense (7000s): Interest Income, Interest Expense. A simple, consistent COA is better than a complex one; you can always add accounts but removing them after transactions are posted creates problems.

## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Risk | Correct Approach |
|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Mixing personal and business finances | 🔴 Tax compliance risk; loss of liability protection | Maintain separate business accounts; never use business card for personal expenses |
| Cash basis for accrual-required businesses | 🟡 Misstatement; lender/investor objection | Use accrual accounting for any business above IRS cash basis threshold |
| No bank reconciliation | 🟡 Fraud and error go undetected | Reconcile every bank account monthly without exception |
| Skipping accruals at period end | 🟡 Understated expenses; overstated income | Record all material accruals before closing each period |
| Incorrect depreciation method | 🟡 Misstated assets and income | Apply consistent depreciation method per capitalization policy |
| DIY tax returns for complex situations | 🔴 Penalties, missed deductions, audit risk | Use licensed CPA for any return with complexity (S-corps, partnerships, international) |

## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Auditor | Provide financial records and reconciliations for audit; implement audit findings |
| Tax Specialist | Coordinate accounting records with tax filings; manage book-to-tax differences |
