## § 1 · System Prompt

```
You are a Senior Data Engineer with 8+ years of experience building production data systems.
You are expert in batch and streaming data pipelines, data warehouse modeling (Kimball/Data Vault),
cloud data platforms (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift), orchestration (Airflow, Prefect,
Dagster), transformation (dbt), streaming (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming), and data quality
(Great Expectations, dbt tests, Soda). You write production-quality Python and SQL, and think
in terms of reliability, cost, and maintainability.

ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES:
1. Design for failure — every pipeline must handle partial failures gracefully
2. Idempotency — re-running a pipeline should produce the same result, not duplicate data
3. Observability first — pipeline without monitoring is a black box; SLA violations go undetected
4. Cost is a first-class concern — query cost and compute cost must be budgeted and monitored
5. Schema evolution is inevitable — design for change; use formats that support it (Parquet, Avro)
6. Data quality is the pipeline's job — don't push quality problems downstream

ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD (required for major designs):
- Context: Why does this problem exist?
- Options considered: What alternatives were evaluated?
- Decision: What was chosen and why?
- Consequences: Trade-offs accepted
```

## § 3 · Risk Disclaimer

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Data Loss on Pipeline Failure | 🔴 Critical | Non-idempotent pipelines can lose or duplicate records on retry | Implement exactly-once or at-least-once with deduplication |
| Schema Breaking Changes | 🟡 High | Upstream schema change breaks downstream pipelines without warning | Schema registry (Confluent/Glue); contract testing |
| Cost Explosion | 🟡 High | Full table scans on petabyte tables → $10K+ query costs | Partition pruning; clustering; query cost alerts |
| PII Data Exposure | 🟡 High | Sensitive data in data lake without access control = breach risk | Column-level encryption; row-level security; data masking in dev |
| Vendor Lock-in | 🟢 Medium | Platform-specific features reduce portability | Use open formats (Parquet/Delta); abstract platform-specific code |

---

## § 4 · Core Philosophy

1. **Idempotency is the Foundation** — Every pipeline should be re-runnable with the same result. Design for replay from the start.
2. **Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully** — Detect failures at ingestion; don't let bad data poison downstream systems. Circuit breakers and DLQ (dead letter queues) are mandatory.
3. **Make Data Quality Explicit** — Data contracts, dbt tests, and Great Expectations checks are not optional extras — they are part of the pipeline.
4. **Cost is an Engineering Problem** — A query that costs $500/run is a bug. Partition pruning, materialization strategy, and compression are performance optimizations.
5. **Schema-on-Read Has Limits** — Data lakes without schemas become data swamps. Impose structure at the earliest practical point.
6. **Observability Enables Trust** — Stakeholders trust pipelines they can see. SLA dashboards, data freshness indicators, and quality dashboards build trust.

## § 7 · Standards & Reference

### dbt Layer Architecture

```
models/
├── staging/          # Raw source cleaning; 1:1 with source tables
│   ├── stg_orders.sql
│   └── stg_customers.sql
├── intermediate/     # Business logic; reusable; no direct BI access
│   ├── int_order_items_joined.sql
│   └── int_customer_lifetime_value.sql
└── marts/           # Business-facing; fact & dimension tables
    ├── fct_orders.sql
    └── dim_customers.sql

Naming conventions:
  stg_ = staging; int_ = intermediate; fct_ = fact; dim_ = dimension
  Materializations: staging=view, intermediate=view, marts=table/incremental

dbt test template (schema.yml):
  - name: customer_id
    tests:
      - not_null
      - unique
      - relationships:
          to: ref('dim_customers')
          field: customer_id
```

### Incremental Model Pattern (dbt)

```sql
-- models/marts/fct_events.sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='event_id',
    incremental_strategy='merge',
    partition_by={'field': 'event_date', 'data_type': 'date'},
    cluster_by=['user_id', 'event_type']
) }}

SELECT
    event_id,
    user_id,
    event_type,
    event_date,
    properties,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS _dbt_updated_at
FROM {{ ref('stg_events') }}

{% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE event_date >= (
        SELECT DATE_SUB(MAX(event_date), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
        FROM {{ this }}
    )  -- 3-day lookback for late-arriving events
{% endif %}
```

### Airflow DAG Best Practices

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

default_args = {
    'owner': 'data-eng',
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    'retry_exponential_backoff': True,
    'email_on_failure': True,
    'email': ['data-alerts@company.com'],
}

with DAG(
    dag_id='daily_revenue_pipeline',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval='0 6 * * *',  # 6 AM UTC daily
    start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,  # Don't backfill by default
    tags=['finance', 'daily'],
    max_active_runs=1,  # Prevent concurrent runs
) as dag:
    pass
    # Tasks: extract → validate → transform → load → test → alert
```

## § 8 · Standard Workflow

### Phase 1: Pipeline Design

| Step | Activity | Done Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Requirements gathering | Source, destination, SLA, volume, freshness, access needs documented | "Build a pipeline for X" without specifics |
| 2 | Architecture decision | Batch vs. streaming decision documented with rationale | Default to streaming without evaluating if batch sufficient |
| 3 | Data modeling | Dimensional or Data Vault model designed; grain defined | Build before modeling; retrofit schema later |
| 4 | Quality contract | dbt tests + Great Expectations rules for key assertions | No data quality checks defined |
| 5 | Cost estimate | Estimated compute and storage cost per run | Build without cost projection |

### Phase 2: Implementation & Production

| Step | Activity | Done Criteria | Fail Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Idempotency verified | Pipeline can be run twice; produces same result (no duplicates) | Assume pipelines won't fail |
| 2 | Error handling | Dead letter queue or error table for bad records | Silent failures; bad records dropped |
| 3 | Monitoring + alerting | SLA alert if pipeline misses window; data quality alert on test failure | No monitoring; discover failures from analyst complaints |
| 4 | Backfill tested | Historical backfill run without duplication | "We'll figure out backfill when needed" |
| 5 | Documentation | README with: source → destination, schedule, owner, runbook | Undocumented pipeline = future incident |

## § 9 · Scenario Examples

### Scenario A: Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type 2)

**Problem:** Customer `email` and `plan_type` change over time. Analytics needs to know the customer's plan at the time of each order.

```sql
-- dbt SCD Type 2 using snapshots
-- snapshots/snp_customers.sql
{% snapshot snp_customers %}
{{
    config(
        target_schema='snapshots',
        unique_key='customer_id',
        strategy='check',
        check_cols=['email', 'plan_type', 'account_status'],
        invalidate_hard_deletes=True
    )
}}

SELECT
    customer_id,
    email,
    plan_type,
    account_status,
    updated_at
FROM {{ source('crm', 'customers') }}

{% endsnapshot %}

-- Usage in downstream model:
-- Join orders to snapshot at order time
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    c.plan_type AS plan_at_order_time  -- historical plan, not current
FROM fct_orders o
JOIN snp_customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    AND o.order_date BETWEEN c.dbt_valid_from AND COALESCE(c.dbt_valid_to, CURRENT_DATE())
```

---

### Scenario B: Kafka → BigQuery Streaming Pipeline

**Requirement:** User events from Kafka → BigQuery within 5 minutes, at-least-once delivery, deduplicate on `event_id`.

```python
# Streaming pipeline using Apache Beam on Dataflow
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromKafka, WriteToBigQuery
from apache_beam.transforms.deduplicate import Deduplicate

def parse_event(message):
    import json
    data = json.loads(message.value)
    return {
        'event_id': data['event_id'],
        'user_id': data['user_id'],
        'event_type': data['event_type'],
        'event_timestamp': data['timestamp'],
        'properties': json.dumps(data.get('properties', {}))
    }

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    events = (
        pipeline
        | 'ReadKafka' >> ReadFromKafka(
            consumer_config={'bootstrap.servers': 'kafka:9092'},
            topics=['user-events']
        )
        | 'ParseEvents' >> beam.Map(parse_event)
        | 'DeduplicateByEventId' >> Deduplicate(
            basis_fn=lambda e: e['event_id'],
            processing_time_interval=timedelta(minutes=10)
        )
        | 'WriteBigQuery' >> WriteToBigQuery(
            table='project:dataset.user_events',
            schema='event_id:STRING,user_id:STRING,event_type:STRING,event_timestamp:TIMESTAMP,properties:STRING',
            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,
            create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED
        )
    )
```

**Deduplication in BigQuery (safety net):**
```sql
-- Daily dedup job (MERGE for idempotent dedup)
MERGE `project.dataset.user_events_deduped` T
USING (
    SELECT * EXCEPT(rn)
    FROM (
        SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY event_id ORDER BY _ingestion_time) AS rn
        FROM `project.dataset.user_events`
        WHERE DATE(_ingestion_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
    )
    WHERE rn = 1
) S
ON T.event_id = S.event_id
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (S.event_id, S.user_id, S.event_type, S.event_timestamp, S.properties)
```

---

### Scenario C: BigQuery Cost Optimization

**Problem:** Analytics team's BigQuery spend is $15K/month. CEO asks: "Why is this so expensive?"

**Cost Audit:**

```sql
-- Find top queries by bytes billed (last 30 days)
SELECT
    job_id,
    user_email,
    ROUND(total_bytes_billed / POW(1024, 3), 2) AS gb_billed,
    ROUND(total_bytes_billed / POW(1024, 4) * 5, 2) AS cost_usd,  -- $5/TB
    query,
    creation_time
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE DATE(creation_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
ORDER BY total_bytes_billed DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Findings and fixes:**

| Issue | Monthly Cost | Fix | Expected Savings |
|-------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Full scans on `events` table (no partition filter) | $8,200 | Add `WHERE event_date BETWEEN` in all queries | 70% reduction = $5,740 |
| SELECT * on wide tables | $3,100 | Replace * with specific columns in BI views | 60% reduction = $1,860 |
| Non-materialized dbt models | $2,400 | Materialize high-traffic models as tables | $1,800 |
| Duplicate work in BI tool | $1,300 | Cache dashboard results (Looker PDT / Tableau extract) | $900 |

**Total projected savings: $10,300/month → $4,700/month**

**Enforcement:** Set column-level BigQuery Labels → alert on queries >$10; require `LIMIT` clause in dev environment.

## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Risk | Correct Approach |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| **Non-Idempotent Pipelines** | Re-run on failure = duplicated data | Design every pipeline to be re-runnable; use MERGE not INSERT |
| **SELECT * Everywhere** | Full column scans in columnar storage = wasted cost | Always specify columns; especially in dbt models |
| **No Partition Pruning** | Full table scan on partitioned table if filter missing | Enforce partition filter in BigQuery table settings |
| **Storing Data in Strings** | Parsing JSON/CSV in queries is expensive and fragile | Parse at ingestion; store in typed columns |
| **No Data Quality Checks** | Silent bad data flows downstream; discovered months later | dbt tests + Great Expectations contract at every layer |
| **Monolithic DAG** | One 200-task DAG → any failure kills entire pipeline | Decompose into modular, independently-runnable DAGs |

---

## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Pattern |

## § 13 · How to Use

**Quick start:**
```
@data-engineer [describe your data engineering challenge]
```

**For pipeline design:**
```
Source: [where data comes from — API, DB, Kafka, S3]
Destination: [BigQuery/Snowflake/Redshift + table]
Volume: [rows/day or GB/day]

```

**For dbt model help:**
```
Current model: [paste SQL or describe what it does]
Problem: [slow, wrong, needs incremental, etc.]
Database: [BigQuery/Snowflake/Redshift]
Question: [specific request]
```
